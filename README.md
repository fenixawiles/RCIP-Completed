Supplementary file: RCIPCompleted.pdf

Purpose

This file documents the one-night recursive case study that served as the empirical foundation for The Recursive Protocol (TRP).
It records how three independent large-language-model systems were engaged in adversarial dialogue to test whether bounded recursion could generate defensible methodological safeguards within a compressed timeframe.

Design Summary

Research Design: Procedural autoethnography

Architecture: Multi-model recursive loop (Claude → Gemini → GPT-5 → Claude)

Iterations: ≈ 17 recursive cycles

Termination Condition: Diminishing methodological returns, performative antagonism, or resource exhaustion—whichever occurred first

Human Role: Single human researcher acting as validity anchor—verifying outputs, enforcing stopping rules, and excluding unverifiable proposals

Analytic Focus

The study applied recursive confrontation to a bounded analytical problem: detecting bias in NBA draft scouting data.
Each loop forced rival framings among the models, producing progressively refined methodological components, including:

EVOE (Epistemically Valid Objective Evaluation): a bias-purged baseline metric replacing contaminated draft-slot expectations

Human Validity Anchor: rule that model consensus never substitutes for human arbitration

Temporal Safeguards: dual bracketing of data inputs (epistemic time locks) and model parameters (temporal reflexivity)

Minimal Viable RCIP System (MVRS): reproducible single-model fallback ensuring transparency and cost control

Outcome

The recursion reached convergence when further loops produced no new safeguards.
The resulting protocol—later formalized as TRP—demonstrated that methodological rigor can emerge through structured antagonism under tight temporal constraints.

Rigor Safeguards

The author served as sole human anchor ensuring interpretive and ethical control.

Unverified or unverifiable data (e.g., algorithmic trait clustering without external validation) were omitted from the TRP manuscript to preserve rigor.

All remaining constructs are analytically defensible and fully documented in this transcript.

Data and Ethics Notes

All data derive from publicly available scouting reports and performance statistics.

Text within the transcript is machine-generated through structured dialogue; no human-subject data appear.

No IRB approval was required.

Relation to TRP Manuscript

This file provides the complete procedural trace referenced throughout Sections 3–6 of the TRP paper.
It substantiates claims about bias-purge design, validation safeguards, and temporal reflexivity that emerged from the recursive process.
